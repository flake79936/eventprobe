Eventprobe Bugs:

- When logging in into the system from the Registration page, the redirection does not work properly. 
Also, the page has to be refreshed to be able to see the site once again after the user has logged in. 
Should not be acting this way.
- Make the event's address validation more robust and add the state and city by zip code
-
