	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Marshawn Lynch</strong> is pretty much the last person you want to mess with on or off the field. Apparently a guy in California didn&#8217;t get the memo when he tried to get on the wrong side of the Seahawks running back this week.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/03/14/tmz-reports-seahawks-marshawn-lynch-involved-in-brawl-outside-sf-bar/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>CBS SAN FRANCISCO</strong></span></a> ,Lynch and his entourage were hassled by an intoxicated man outside a San Francisco bar on Friday.</p>
<p>The man tried taunting the NFL star, allegedly calling Lynch a “Seattle sea chicken.”</p>
<p>Sources say, “Someone in Marshawn’s crew snapped and a melee erupted.”</p>
<p>In footage from the fight, it looks as if Lynch is actually attempting to pull one of his friends away from the fight but witnesses reportedly said &#8220;Marshawn got in a few punches before walking away.”</p>
<p>Lynch hasn’t revealed anything on social media or to the press about his involvement in the fight and the Seattle Seahawks haven’t issued a statement.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kmps.cbslocal.com&#038;blog=33377589&#038;post=160593&#038;subd=cbskmps2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://radio.com/tag/steven-tyler/" target="_blank">Steven Tyler</a>, legendary frontman of&nbsp;<a href="http://radio.com/tag/aerosmith/" target="_blank">Aerosmith</a>, has not kept it a secret that he is making a country album and intends to make a full transition to a country artist, at least for the short term. This shift has included a move to Nashville and now seems to be getting a big backing.</p>
<p><em>Billboard</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6502015/aerosmith-steven-tyler-country-album-big-machine" target="_blank">reporting</a>&nbsp;that Big Machine Label Group is in the process of signing Tyler, and that the move could be completed in the next few weeks. The move shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise as Tyler was recently featured in a taped segment on&nbsp;<em>American Idol</em>&nbsp;devoted to Scott Borchetta, the group&#8217;s president and CEO.</p>
<p>Tyler would be joining notable signees Taylor Swift, Tim McGraw, Reba McEntire and The Band Perry. He is reportedly working with notable Nashville songwriters, including Brett James.</p>

<p>Yes, the&nbsp;<a href="http://radio.com/tag/eagles/" target="_blank">Eagles</a>&nbsp;are back on the road this spring and summer with a whole new set of arena dates for their long-running History of The Eagles tour.</p>

<p>Check out the dates and venues below, but don&#8217;t hold your breath for a new Eagles album, which would be the follow-up to 2007&prime;s&nbsp;<em>Long Road Out of Eden</em>, and is still a long way from release.&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Classic Rock</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/eagles-2015-us-tour/" target="_blank">points out</a>, though, that this year could see the release of a new&nbsp;<a href="/tag/don-henley" target="_blank">Don Henley</a>&nbsp;solo album,&nbsp;<em>Cass County</em>, which has been completed since 2013.</p>

According to&nbsp;<a href="http://tasteofcountry.com/luke-bryan-music-lyanna-flynn-leukemia/" target="_blank"><em>Taste of Country</em></a>, Flynn was diagnosed in February. In between chemotherapy and taking pills she doesn&#8217;t like, Bryan&#8217;s music helps her get through it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke Bryan&#8217;s music is her medicine,&rdquo; her father, Chad Flynn told&nbsp;<em>Taste of Country</em>.</p>
<p>Appreciative of Bryan&#8217;s music during his family&#8217;s difficult time, Chad took a video of his daughter in the hospital. As she urges Lyanna to take her medicine he promises her, &#8220;After you take your medicine you can listen to your music.&#8221;</p>

See if you remember him in these five films.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kmps.cbslocal.com&#038;blog=33377589&#038;post=160570&#038;subd=cbskmps2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>By Scott T. Sterling</strong></em></p>
<p>Thanks to the runaway success of 2008 movie&nbsp;<em>Taken</em>,&nbsp;<a href="/tag/Liam-Neeson" target="_blank">Liam Neeson</a>&nbsp;has become one of Hollywood&#8217;s most bankable action heroes, best known for a particular set of skills: stealthily kicking bad-guy ass up and down the big screen with steely-eyed ease, all while delivering lines in his signature Irish brogue.</p>
<p>With a pair of&nbsp;<em>Taken</em>&nbsp;sequels and a series of equally ass-kicking roles since (including this weekend&#8217;s new release,&nbsp;<em>Run All Night</em>), Neeson&#8217;s reputation as cinema&#8217;s revenge-minded superstar has earned the actor a spot in the pop culture pantheon worthy of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC2qk2X3fKA" target="_blank">parody Super Bowl ads</a>&nbsp;and hilarious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGuPKSBpyBY" target="_blank">Key &amp; Peele comedy sketches</a>.</p>
<p>Long before the beat-downs and dry one-liners, though, Neeson was a well-respected movie actor with a 1993 Best Actor Oscar nomination under his belt for&nbsp;<em>Schindler&#8217;s List</em>&nbsp;(the award would go to Tom Hanks for&nbsp;<em>Philadelphia</em>).</p>
<p>But even setting&nbsp;aside&nbsp;<em>Schindler&#8217;s List,&nbsp;</em>Neeson still has a diverse resume. In fact, he&#8217;s starred in quite a few decidedly&nbsp;<em>non</em>-badass movie roles during his career, all of which could come as something of a shock to the generation of filmgoers who only know him as a name-taking butt-kicker. Below&nbsp;are five of our favorites.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>1.&nbsp;<strong><em>Satisfaction</em></strong>&nbsp;(1988)</h2>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='620' height='349' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/rDwSi2CLTtA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>This teen coming of age film follows a mostly female band (complete with Julia Roberts on left-handed bass) looking for their one big break. In this case, that big break comes in the form of Liam Neeson&#8217;s club-owning character, Martin Falcon. Neeson gets to hook up with the much-younger Justine Bateman character, and plenty of hilarity and drama ensue en route to the predictably happy ending.</p>

<p>This holiday-themed romantic comedy boasts quite the ensemble cast, with Neeson starring alongside the likes of Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley&nbsp;and Alan Rickman. It has a particularly high creep-factor for being a holiday rom-com, including Neeson&#8217;s character helping his young son get over the untimely death of his mother by encouraging him to pursue a love interest who just so happens to share the mother&#8217;s name. Ew!</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Miranda Lambert</strong> has worked hard to eat healthier and stay fit, but sometimes a girl just has to get down with some comfort food.</p>
<p>The blonde bombshell admitted that she has no problem still eating greasy food.</p>
<p>Lambert told <a href="http://www.elle.com/culture/music/news/a27255/the-miranda-lambert-guide-to-body-acceptance/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Elle</strong></span></a>, &#8220;I was at the Loveless Cafe in Nashville. I&#8217;d never been there and basically caused a scene with my biscuit eating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not sure how many biscuits she downed, but she did own up to it. She added, &#8220;I got back out on the road, where I&#8217;m traveling with my trainer, and I was like, &#8216;I need to confess something.&#8217; He was like, &#8216;It&#8217;s okay, but we&#8217;re going to run today.'&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to fad diets and calorie counting, Lambert is not a fan. She went on to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think diets work. I think it&#8217;s a choice you make every single day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lambert&#8217;s fit new physique has even gotten some fan feedback during concert meet &amp; greets. Lambert said, &#8220;This girl came up to me in a meet &amp; greet and said, &#8216;Just so you know, it&#8217;s because of you that I threw away my scale.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best help I could provide because I&#8217;ve been a lot of sizes in my career. I&#8217;ve always tried to rock what I&#8217;ve got, no matter what my body is at the time. She was like, a normal size girl, and for her to say that, it really made me feel good.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kmps.cbslocal.com&#038;blog=33377589&#038;post=160562&#038;subd=cbskmps2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/tag/sam-hunt" target="_blank">Sam Hunt</a>&nbsp;just celebrated his second consecutive No. 1 on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6472672/sam-hunt-heartland" target="_blank"><em>Billboard</em>&#8216;s Hot Country Songs chart&nbsp;</a>with his latest single &#8220;Take Your Time,&#8221; and while the song, which he cowrote with Shane McAnally and Josh Osbourne, tells the tale of him talking to a girl, the video for the song takes a far more serious turn.</p>
<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href="http://radio.com/2014/10/23/new-music-to-know-sam-hunt-interview/" target="_blank">New Music to Know: Sam Hunt Combines His Love For Usher &amp; Steve Earle on Debut &lsquo;Montevallo&rsquo;</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Take Your Time&#8221; was filmed in Nashville last month and directed by Tim Mattia of London Alley Production. The video begins with a fight breaking out and it isn&#8217;t clear who is punching who. As the video continues, we see Hunt walking down a street alone.</p>
<p>Multiple story lines flush out that show Hunt observing a beautiful girl in a laundromat and at his open mic night, but she has big problems at home. The young mother is in an abusive relationship, and as the video develops we see she&#8217;s planning her escape.&nbsp;</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting a box of <strong>Girl Scout</strong> cookies is already one of the greatest experiences, but how would amazing would it be if <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> was the one selling it to you?</p>
<p>The Academy Award-winning actor was shopping in the San Francisco Bay Area over the weekend and he came across a Girl Scout troop selling cookies according to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-hanks-helps-girl-scouts-sell-cookies/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>CBS News.</strong></span></a></p>
<p>The actor not only bought four boxes of Girl Scout cookies and donated an additional $20 to the troop; he also offered to have his photo taken with people who recognized him, so long as they bought cookies, too.</p>
<p>As for what cookies the actor has a sweet tooth for, we may never know. The girl scouts didn&#8217;t reveal wether he went home with Thin Mints, Tagalongs or Samoas.</p>
<p>That will have to remain a mystery until next cookie season when Hanks might just stop by to help another troop hit their cookie goal.</p>

	    		    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://live105.cbslocal.com/2015/03/12/grand-theft-auto-bbc/" target="_blank"><em><strong>By Alyssa Pereira, CBS San Francisco</strong></em></a></p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, one of the biggest video games in the world, is going to see a new format soon&mdash;television.</p>
<p>Today the BBC announced that they will be developing a drama for television based on the game as part of their &#8220;Make It Digital&#8221; initiative, which revolves around technology.</p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, which took in around $800 million in its first 24 hours on sale and broke $1 billion in its first three days.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;the series&nbsp;is very popular, most gamers&nbsp;are aware of GTA&#8217;s&nbsp;graphic depictions of violence, sex and drug use. Many&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/malika-saada-saar/grand-theft-auto-v-and-the-culture-of-violence-against-women_b_6288528.html" target="_blank">have condemned</a>&nbsp;the game for its portrayals of women, saying it cultivates an unhealthy perspective of misogyny, and some stores&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/target-australia-bans-grand-theft-auto-v-for-its-violence-ag#.cbKRZaoqR" target="_blank">have even banned</a>&nbsp;the sale of the game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the show will be the subject of some controversy.</p>
<p>As of yet, there is no news about the premise or premiere date for&nbsp;the new show.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kmps.cbslocal.com&#038;blog=33377589&#038;post=160556&#038;subd=cbskmps2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
